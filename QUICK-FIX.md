# Quick Fix: NotServedByPagesError

## The Problem
```
timeherenow.com is improperly configured
Domain does not resolve to the GitHub Pages server (NotServedByPagesError)
```

## The Solution (2 minutes)

### What's Wrong
- ✅ DNS is correct
- ✅ CNAME file exists and is deployed
- ❌ **Custom domain not configured in GitHub repository settings**

### Fix It Now

1. **Go to repository settings**:
   https://github.com/rodit-org/homepage-discernible-io/settings/pages

2. **Find the "Custom domain" section**

3. **Enter your domain**:
   ```
   timeherenow.com
   ```

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for DNS verification

6. **Done!** Visit http://timeherenow.com

### Why This Happens

GitHub Pages needs TWO things:
1. **DNS pointing to GitHub** ✅ (you have this)
2. **GitHub knowing which repo to serve** ❌ (this is missing)

The custom domain setting in repository settings creates the mapping between your domain and your repository.

### After It Works

- Wait 10-15 more minutes for HTTPS certificate
- Then enable "Enforce HTTPS" in the same settings page
- Visit https://timeherenow.com
